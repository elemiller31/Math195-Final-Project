    "We will be analyzing the congressional district maps in Georgia followwing the 2020 census. Currently Georgia's congressional map is in litigation so we want to examine how that could have effected the 2024 U.S. House election. We will be looking at their 2021 plan which was used for the 2022 election and then a new 2023 plan which was used in the 2024 election. The 2023 plan was a placeholder to fix some of the issues with the 2021 so the 2024 election would have a less problematic map."
