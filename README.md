# Texas

Currently the congressional district map in Texas is in ligatigation. We want to see how that affected the outcome of the election for the U.S. House of Representatives. The current plan was enacted on October 25, 2021.

We downloaded the congressional map from the Texas Legislative Council on the Capitol Data Portal at https://data.capitol.texas.gov/dataset/planc2193.


Didn't elect a Senator in 2022 but need elect Governor and Attonery General. However, Governor did have some big names: Republican candidate was incumbent, running for his third term, and the Democratic one was Beto O'Rourke. However, the Attorney General's Republican candidate was facing fraud charges and being investigated by the FBI, and many GOP did not endorse or like him.
