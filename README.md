# Alabama

Alabama is currently stuck in the Milligan case .. I think I found the plans from before and after.


Use maup.assign to assign the Congressional Districts to the Voting precinct data.
Use a join to combine the US Census demographic precinct data to the Voting precinct data.

This should form one big shapefile with all the info needed.
Then, can plot based on each congressional districting plan, as well as a randomly-generated plan.
