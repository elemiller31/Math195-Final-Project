# Texas

Currently the congressional district map in Texas is in ligatigation. We want to see how that affected the outcome of the election for the U.S. House of Representatives. The current plan was enacted on October 25, 2021.

We downloaded the congressional map from the Texas Legislative Council on the Capitol Data Portal at https://data.capitol.texas.gov/dataset/planc2193.


For all of these, we should be able to use US Senate results to represent the US House elections


Didn't elect a Senator in 2022 - need to look at another state-wide race
Maybe can find another race to use here? https://redistrictingdatahub.org/dataset/texas-2022-general-election-results-on-texas-voting-tabulation-districts/
