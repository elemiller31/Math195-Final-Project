# Texas

Currently the congressional district map in Texas is in ligatigation. We want to see how that affected the outcome of the election for the U.S. House of Representatives. The current plan was enacted on October 25, 2021.

We downloaded the congressional map from the Texas Legislative Council on the Capitol Data Portal at https://data.capitol.texas.gov/dataset/planc2193.


Presidential 2020 data from: https://election.lab.ufl.edu/dataset/tx-2020-precinct-level-election-results/
