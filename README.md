## Tennessee:
Didn't elect a Senator in 2022 - need to look at another state-wide race

## Arkansas
There was a US Senate Election in 2022, but I can't find the data for it?

## Texas
Didn't elect a Senator in 2022 - need to look at another state-wide race
Maybe can find another race to use here? https://redistrictingdatahub.org/dataset/texas-2022-general-election-results-on-texas-voting-tabulation-districts/

## New Mexico
Didn't elect a Senator in 2022

## Utah
Senate election but can't find the data on it

## Nevada
US Senate Election: https://redistrictingdatahub.org/dataset/nevada-2022-general-election-precinct-level-results/
-> there were two different data sets at the Precinct-level. Might want to compare and see if there are any differences between them?
