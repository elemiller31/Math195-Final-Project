Alaska
------
Election results from Alaska Division of Elections (https://www.elections.alaska.gov/election-results/e/?id=22genr). Precinct shapefile from Alaska Division of Elections (https://www.elections.alaska.gov/research/district-maps/).

Early, absentee, and questioned votes are reported at the state house district level (since Alaska has portions of the state with no lower level of government, HDs serve a similar purpose as counties do in other states for the process of reporting votes). Overseas federal absentee ballots are reported at the statewide level. These votes are apportioned by candidate to precincts based on the precinct-level reported vote as weighted according to the number of ballots cast by vote type in each precinct.

Maine
-----
Election results by township from the Maine Bureau of Corporations, Elections & Commissions (https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/results/index.html). Election results by ward from municipal reports for Auburn, Augusta, Belfast, Cranberry Isles, Ellsworth, Gorham, Lewiston, Portland, Sanford, South Portland.

Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau 2020 Redistricting Data Program. Voting district shapefiles were available for Androscoggin, Cumberland, Kennebec, Sagadahoc, Waldo, York. County subdivision shapefiles were used instead for Aroostook, Franklin, Hancock, Knox, Lincoln, Oxford, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Somerset, Washington.

VTDs were merged for Bath, Brunswick, Saco, Waterville, Westbrook as statewide offices were not reported by ward. VTDs for Cranberry Isles, Ellsworth, Gorham were sourced from township ward maps.

Absentee votes were reported by township for Auburn, Augusta, Gorham, Lewiston, Portland, Sanford, South Portland. Military and overseas ballots (UOCAVA) were reported statewide. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level vote for the given reporting unit.

Maine includes more than 400 unorganized townships that do not lie within municipal bounds. While some are featured separately, the U.S. Census Bureau combines most of these into larger unorganized territories. Voters in unorganized townships generally register and vote at nearby incorporated townships. In some cases these votes are reported separately while in others they are combined into the total vote reported from the central voting location. The shapefile has been modified accordingly using the Town Boundaries shapefile from the Maine Office of GIS. For those unorganized townships that do not appear on any registration or election reports the Census boundaries have been retained unaltered. A scattering of unorganized townships with intermittent or inconsistent voter registration have also been omitted.

North Carolina
--------------
Election results and precinct shapefile from the NC State Board of Elections (https://www.ncsbe.gov/results-data).

Henderson CV, Wake 01-07A, 07-07A are missing from the 20220831 shapefile. They are added from the respective county precinct shapefiles.

North Carolina produces two sets of election results data. The precinct results are the unaltered results as initially reported by the counties. Many counties report early votes by vote center while provisional and other nonstandard ballots may be reported countywide. The precinct-sorted results are then produced within 30 days after the election. In the precinct-sorted data nearly all votes are assigned to precincts regardless of the manner by which the ballots were cast. However, North Carolina law requires the addition of statistical "noise" to the precinct-sorted data wherever any given vote by any specific voter may otherwise be deduced via cross referencing the various election-related data sets produced by the SBE.

For the 2022 general election 55 counties reported all votes by precinct in their initial precinct results. The precinct-sorted data set was used instead for the counties listed below.

Alleghany, Avery, Beaufort, Bertie, Bladen, Buncombe, Cabarrus, Caldwell*, Camden, Currituck, Dare, Davidson, Davie, Durham*, Edgecombe, Guilford, Halifax*, Haywood, Henderson, Hoke, Hyde, Johnston, Jones, Lee, Macon, Martin*, Mecklenburg, Moore, Nash, New Hanover*, Northampton*, Orange, Perquimans, Pitt*, Polk, Richmond, Scotland, Stokes*, Surry*, Tyrrell, Wake, Washington, Watauga, Wilkes, Yadkin

In counties marked by asterisk some votes were still reported by vote center or countywide in the precinct-sorted data. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on the precinct-level reported vote. The precinct-sorted results were further adjusted to match the certified countywide totals based on the precinct-level vote by candidate.

Utah
----
Election results from individual county canvass reports mainly via the Utah Lieutenant Governor’s Office (https://vote.utah.gov/obtain-voter-registration-or-election-data/). Precinct shapefile from the Utah Geospatial Resource Center (https://gis.utah.gov/data/political/voter-precincts/).

The shapefile from UGRC features subprecincts, breaking down precincts in cases of district splits. In many counties election results were reported at the subprecinct level, but for counties where results were instead reported at the precinct level subprecincts were merged accordingly.

In Grand County, the aggregate precinct results for US Senate include one more vote for McMullin (I) than the certified countywide total. This appears to have been a Write-In vote later counted for McMullin.

Write-In votes are not directly comparable between counties. Some counties only report official write-ins while others also include invalid write-ins in the precinct results. Utah County did not record any write-in votes by precinct for the 2022 general election.

Vermont
-------
Election results from the Vermont Secretary of State (https://vtelectionarchive.sec.state.vt.us/).
Precinct shapefile from the U.S. Census Bureau 2022 TIGER/Line Shapefiles.

The Census VTD shapefile features city wards. However, precinct boundaries for state and federal elections are not based on city wards. They are instead defined by legislative districts wherever they cross municipal boundaries. Therefore, the county subdivision shapefile of municipalities was instead split into precincts wherever necessary using the state legislative district shapefile.

Vermont has four unorganized towns whose residents cast votes in neighboring towns. These were distributed back based on voting age population in the 2020 U.S. Census and the 2022 American Community Survey (Averill-Canaan, Buel's Gore-Huntington, Ferdinand-Brighton, Glastenbury-Shaftsbury.)

Virginia
--------
Election results from the Virginia Department of Elections (https://results.elections.virginia.gov/vaelections/2022%20November%20General/Site/Congress.html). Precinct shapefiles from the Virginia Department of Elections (https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/redistricting/gis/).

Absentee results for some precincts in Arlington, Carroll, Grayson, Lee were adjusted to account for apparent data entry errors using the List of Those Who Voted provided by the Virginia Department of Elections. Absentee results for Nottoway County were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the election day precinct-level reported vote.

The border of Chesapeake City and Suffolk City reflects a de facto misalignment that was not corrected before 2022.

Wisconsin
---------
Election results from the Wisconsin Elections Commission (https://elections.wi.gov/elections/election-results). Precinct shapefile from the Wisconsin Legislative Technology Services Bureau (https://gis-ltsb.hub.arcgis.com/).

Wisconsin election results frequently combine multiple wards within a given reporting unit. Election results were disaggregated from reporting units to individual wards proportional to the total number of registered voters within the constituent wards in the subsequent ward-level registration report.

LTSB collects ward boundaries in January and July of each year. However, voting ward boundaries continue to change until a few weeks before the general election due to annexations, incorporations, and other boundary agreements. Ward boundaries were therefore edited wherever necessary to coincide with the 2022 general election based on a comprehensive review of relevant ordinances in the Wisconsin Department of Administration Municipal Data System. A scattering of ward numbers across the state were also edited to match the 2022 voter registration file.

The baseline shapefiles for the following counties are from the 2023 LTSB municipal wards shapefile: Crawford, Grant, Green Lake, Iron, Jefferson, Oneida, St. Croix, Waupaca.
