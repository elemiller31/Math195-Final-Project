South Carolina 2022 General Election Precinct Boundaries and Election Results

## RDH Date Retrieval
4/3/2024

## Sources
Election results via [OpenElections](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-sc) with Statewide Amendment results in Clarendon County added manually and precinct name changes made in Lancaster County based on [state results](https://scvotes.gov/elections-statistics/election-results/).

Precinct boundaries sourced South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office via email. Precinct shapes in Horry County sourced via [Horry County GIS Portal](https://gisportal.horrycounty.org/portal/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=ae801c3df926436e81add8a16eecd297). Three precinct names were swapped in Beaufort County based off information from state results, linked above, and a South Carolina voter file, pulled on April 3, 2023 from L2.

## Notes on Field Names (adapted from VEST):
Columns reporting votes generally follow the pattern: 
One example is:
G16PREDCLI
The first character is G for a general election, P for a primary, S for a special, and R for a runoff.
Characters 2 and 3 are the year of the election.*
Characters 4-6 represent the office type (see list below).
Character 7 represents the party of the candidate.
Characters 8-10 are the first three letters of the candidate's last name.

*To fit within the GIS 10 character limit for field names, the naming convention is slightly different for the State Legislature and US House of Representatives. All fields are listed below with definitions.

## Notes
Precinct-level vote totals were checked against county-level totals and matched for every race in every county.

Precinct geometries were checked against the precinct assignments of individual voters in a New Mexico voter file pulled on April 3, 2023 from L2. 

Results are split across three files due to precincts split by districts. These files are the most accurate files for election results disaggregation. The "sc_2022_gen_pber_no_splits" does not make these splits and as such, does not contain district assignments.
