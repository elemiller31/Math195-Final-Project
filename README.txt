## Election Results Processing Notes
Files were checked against separate statewide and countywide election result files from the [Florida Department of State Election Archive](https://results.elections.myflorida.com/Index.asp?ElectionDate=11/8/2022&DATAMODE=) for all races but the following: ['G22CFOOWRI', 'G22GOVOWRI', 'GCON12OWRI', 'GCON13OWRI', 'GCON16OWRI', 'GCON18OWRI', 'GCON19OWRI', 'GCON28OWRI', 'GCON04OWRI', 'GCON07OWRI', 'GSL015OWRI', 'GSL016OWRI', 'GSL003OWRI', 'GSL030OWRI', 'GSU33OWRI', 'GSU05OWRI','G22USSOWRI']. The election archive results had vote totals for particular candidates in some of these races, but we confirmed that the "OWRI" results contained results for more than just the particular candidates listed in the archive results, and as such did not match.

For the races we were able to check, totals matched in every county except for Miami-Dade and Seminole county. In Miami-Dade, there were two more total votes in the precinct-level results in the following races: GSL106RBAS and GSL106DLEO. Although the precinct-level file contained a file with recount election results for this file, the results summed to tens of thousands of votes higher than the official totals and as such were not used.

In Seminole County, the largest difference was 12 fewer votes in the precinct-level file for the G22SCJNGRO race. Full details can be found in the notebook linked below. It is not immediately clear why these differences exist.


## Precinct Boundary Processing Notes
Please note that although we produced this file to be as accurate as possible, we may come across additional information in the future which may require us to update this file.

Precinct boundaries for 30 of Florida's 67 counties are sourced from VEST's 2020 map. VEST data for those counties appeared to have no changes in the names or counts of precincts since the 2020 general election.

Precinct boundaries for 19 counties are sourced from county Supervisor of Elections offices. For six of those counties, RDH staff constructed precinct boundary maps from census block assignment files.

Precinct boundaries for 18 counties are sourced from the map compiled by RDH volunteer Sebastian Pojman. RDH staff verified these boundaries by comparing them to maps hosted online by each county, mostly in interactive or PDF forms that were not otherwise downloadable as GIS files.

The original Pojman map file included some duplicate precinct ID labels. RDH staff visually inspected shapes associated with those labels and determined which ones should be retained and dissolved together. The majority of duplicates were small geometries that overlapped other precinct areas. Such duplicates were removed.

Note: The revised version of the Pojman map addressed duplicates by dissolving all of them, rather than removing some. This caused some precinct boundaries to include erroneous, non-contiguous shapes. For this reason, RDH staff mostly used the original version. The revised version is used for two counties where substantial edits to the map improved accuracy.

Precinct IDs for some counties in the Pojman and VEST files did not match precinct IDs in RDH election results. In such cases, RDH staff manually created dictionaries that matched precincts using vote totals, polling location names, and/or visual inspection on Google Maps.

Precinct boundaries in all counties were visually checked against the L2 voter file. RDH staff overlayed the compiled precinct boundary map on top of a map of voters, represented as dots located at their registered home address and colored according to their 2022 general election precinct assignment. All boundaries appeared to encompass the correct set of voters. 

In instances when votes from the election results could not be matched to specific precincts, RDH allocated those votes proportionally to (a) precincts across the whole county or (b) precincts with shapes that likely contain those votes.  

Some precincts are split across Congressional, House of Representatives or State Senate Districts. In these cases, the precincts can be split into the particular areas contained in each district using a district shapefile and one can give the votes for the candidates in those particular districts to that district's portion of the precinct. This extra step makes block-level disaggregation and RPV analyses more accurate. For races outside of those particular districts, one does not know the proportion of votes to allot to each district-precinct chunk. As such, separate files are created to ensure the accuracy of votes. Because there were splits for Congress, House of Representatives and State Senate Districts, files for each of these levels, as well as for statewide elections, were created. 

In some cases, a precinct may have votes for multiple districts, but does not spatially intersect with all districts for which it contains votes. This could either be evidence that a precinct's boundaries are incorrect, or simply an instance in which a voter either voted or had their vote counted at the incorrect precinct. For the level-specific files mentioned above, we look into the precinct shapefiles and, unless we find a particular precinct boundary to change, these votes are dropped. For details on the exact number of votes dropped, please see the Jupyter Notebook linked below.

There is also a "fl_2022_gen_prec_no_splits" file, which contains all election results, but does not include a SLDL_DIST, SLDU_DIST or CONG_DIST column.
