## Additional Notes
Files were checked against separate statewide and countywide election result files from the Florida Department of State Election Archive (https://results.elections.myflorida.com/Index.asp?ElectionDate=11/8/2022&DATAMODE=) for all races but the following: ['G22CFOOWRI', 'G22GOVOWRI', 'GCON12OWRI', 'GCON13OWRI', 'GCON16OWRI', 'GCON18OWRI', 'GCON19OWRI', 'GCON28OWRI', 'GCON04OWRI', 'GCON07OWRI', 'GSL015OWRI', 'GSL016OWRI', 'GSL003OWRI', 'GSL030OWRI', 'GSU33OWRI', 'GSU05OWRI','G22USSOWRI']. The election archive results had vote totals for particular candidates in some of these races, but we confirmed that the "OWRI" results contained results for more than just the particular candidates listed in the archive results, and as such did not match.

For the races we were able to check, totals matched in every county except for Miami-Dade and Seminole county. In Miami-Dade, there were two more total votes in the precinct-level results in the following races: GSL106RBAS and GSL106DLEO. Although the precinct-level file contained a file with recount election results for this file, the results summed to tens of thousands of votes higher than the official totals and as such were not used.

In Seminole County, the largest difference was 12 fewer votes in the precinct-level file for the G22SCJNGRO race. Full details can be found in the notebook linked below. It is not immediately clear why these differences exist.
