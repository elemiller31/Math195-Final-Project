## Notes
This file allocates absentee and  votes passed on precinct-level vote share. With the exception of Jefferson County, absentee and provisional votes are recorded at the county level. In Jefferson County, absentee and provisional votes are divided into Birmingham and Bessemer divisions. The RDH determined which precincts fell into these two sections using data from the Jefferson County website. Two contests,GSL016RSOU and GSL056DTIL, contained absentee and provisional votes recorded in the Birmingham division, but no precinct-level votes in any precincts in the Birmingham division. The 3 and 22 votes respectively in these contests were zeroed out and removed from the file. With the exception of these two contests, statewide election result totals match those of the official 2022 General Election Canvass of Results, available at the same link as the precinct-level election results.
